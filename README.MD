# Find Food

#### The Find Food app is designed to help individuals find locations that provide food and also help individuals looking to give their time and/or resources to those in need.

# User Story

As a resident of Philadelphia, I want to have one central location to find food. It will provide me a way to search for local food banks  to obtain food, a soup kitchen for a hot meal, locate agencies looking for volunteers, and the ability to see local and national food insecurity organizations. I also want the ability to donate my time and resources to those that are in need.

When I arrive at the website then I am able to use the search feature to find the five closest food bank locations to my current zip code. 

When I click on the additional organization links provided I am taken to their individual websites where I will be able to view additional information and other options on a larger regional and/or national scale.

When I click on the volunteer tab I am then able to input my personal information in order to be contacted to give my time and/or resources to persons and organizations in need.

# Technologies Used to Develop Application

We used the following technologies for the design, coding, and interface of our web application: 

* **Bulma:** as a CSS Framework to help create our modal, carousel slider, and the page layout for each element.

* **JavaScript:** to write the code to create the modal, carousel slider, and for interacting with the APIs.

* **APIs:** the first one used was Feeding Sites of Philadelphia Philabundance to allow the end user to find the closest food banks to their location and Google Maps for placing markers on a map of each location.

* **GitHub:** to create and host our repository.
