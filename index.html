                    <p>Feeding Philly is a non-profit organization leading the movement to end hunger in the City of Brotherly Love. We have an extensive network of community and organizational partners across the state that distribute food to Philadelphians who need it. We supply the food to hundreds of food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and faith-based organizations that serve food-insecure Philadelphians.</p>

                    <p>Feeding people, strengthening communities, and ending hunger for more Philadelpians. We partner with critical service providers to offer food coupled with other services to help break the cycle of poverty and end hunger for good. We supplement this work with outreach programs that provide direct food assistance, educate the public on the importance of good nutrition, and fight hunger through innovative means.</p>

                    <p>Today, we are serving more working families, more children, and more seniors - but it's not enough. We need to offer solutions that help Philadelphia communities end hunger for good. In addition to sourcing and distributing more nutritiouc food, such as produce and proteins, we seek to understand and eradicate the root causes of hunger. The Feeding Philly's fight against hunger takes on added momentum through ongoing awareness.</p>
